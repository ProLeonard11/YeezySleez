        <h2>YeezySleez</h2>
        <p>This is the official page for the YeezySleez TikTok account.</p>
        <p>I started my page in March of 2022</p>
        <video>
          <source src="first-tiktok.mp4" />
        </video>
        <p id="10k">
          As you can see the quality was not very good and at the time I only
          got around 200 views, and only about 20 likes. However, I kept posting
          multiple videos a day until I got my first 10k video.
        </p>
        <video>
          <source src="first 10k video.mp4" />
        </video>
        <p>Then about a month later I got my first million view video. It was a very succesful Drake video, following this video I recieved lots of duets from other creators who also gained millions of views on their accounts, around this time was when I hit the <strong> 10k milestone</strong> in followers.</p>

            <source src="drake.mp4">
        </video>
        <p>Some of the people who dueted included Devon reacts and other creators. Following this my page gained another 5k followers now I was up to around <strong>15k followers</strong></p>

        <p>After a month or two i got to around <strong>25k followers</strong> partially due to my most viewed vieo at the time.</p>
        <video>
          <source src="DJ khaled.mp4">
        </video>
        <p>Then I started my most popular and succesful series on TikTok, best beat switches in rap</p>
        <video>
          <source src="asap rocky.mp4">
        </video>
        <p>After posting these videos I gained lots of followers and was now up to around 30k, then I took a little break from postin then came back with my most popular video to date</p>
